Challenge 1
-----------
Embedded in this block of text is the password for level 2.
The password is the longest substring that is the same in reverse.

As an example, if the input was "I like racecars that go fast"
the password would be "racecar".

Challenge 2
-----------
To get the password for level 3, write code to find the first prime
fibonacci number larger than a given minimum.  For example, the first
prime fibonacci number larger than 10 is 13.

When you are ready, go here or call this automated
number (415) 799-9454.

You will receive additional instructions at that time.  For the second portion
of this task, note that for the number 12 we consider the sum of the prime divisors
to be 2 + 3 = 5.  We do not include 2 twice even though it divides 12 twice.

Challenge 3
-----------
For the final task, you must find all subsets of an array
where the largest number is the sum of the remaining numbers.
For example, for an input of:

(1, 2, 3, 4, 6)

the subsets would be

1 + 2 = 3
1 + 3 = 4
2 + 4 = 6
1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Here is the list of numbers you should run your code on.
The password is the number of subsets.  In the above case the
answer would be 4.
